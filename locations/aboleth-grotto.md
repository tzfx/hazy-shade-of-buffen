## Description

The aboleth grotto is a large cavernous area that is under the waters of Lake Barotok in Barovia.  

It's approximately 50 feet squared (10x10 tiles.) in size. The entrance to the grotto is from the south, an underwater passage about 10ft in diameter. This passage itself is about 15ft in length, and emerges, underwater, at the bottom of Lake Barotok. This passage is just large enough to allow the aboleth free travel in and out, connecting with the main pool of the grotto at a depth of 10ft.

The grotto consists of a main pool, 15ft deep at its deepest. The water of this pool is very cloudy and only allows normal sight up to 5ft if a player is completely in it. If a player is are afflicted with underwater breathing via the aboleth's mucus cloud, they will be able to see unrestricted, as if the pool were competely clear. The pool is ringed with a 15ft patch of mostly dry land. Small tidal pools are here and there, but the dry area should be counted as normal terrain while players are standing on it. Small-to-medium piles of stone are scattered around the perimeter, provding at most 1/2 cover for a medium sized creature. 

The grotto itself has a 20ft high ceiling at it's highest point at the center, which glows with arcane energy, which casts the entire area in dim, blue/purple light. 3 large natural columns extend from the ceiling down to the base of the grotto, set at seemingly random spots.

## Ceiling

If the party is not in active combat with the aboleth, the ceiling glows with a dim blue light.

If the party is in active combat with the abolethm the clieling glows with a bright light, brightly illuminating the entire grotto.

The color of the ceiling changes on the aboleth's turn in accordance with the next lair action to be taken by the aboleth on intiative 20.

blue - phatasmal force
purple - tidal surge
red - tidal rage

In addition to these, the ceiling with crackle with energy if the aboleth has a charmed target and is planning on using Psychic Drain during the current round.


## Columns

There are three natural columns spanning the height of the grotto. At quick glance they appear to be just natural formations that are part of the grotto.

Outside of combat, these columns are dull. Once the aboleth has been engaged, they begin to glow with the same intensity as the ceiling.

- DC20 (DC5 in combat) perception check of the column reveals tiny, inscribed runes adoring the base of each of the columns.
- DC10 (DC5 in combat) history check reveals them to be the icons of the fanes of Barovia.
- DC20 (DC15 in combat) arcane check reveals that a bonus action can be used to touch a column and choose one of the following buffs for 1h:

1. Blessing of the Huntress.

    > The character is imbued with deadly focus, They gain advantage on any one attack or spell cast they make per round. They also gain advantage on any ability checks (not saving throws). They also gain advantage on wisdom saving throws.
2. Blessing of the Weaver.

    > The character is imbued with the magicks of the weave. They gain immunity to the aboleth's enslave or probing telepathy. They gain advantage on wisdom saving throws. They gain 20 temporary hit points. Upon any member of the party receiving this blessing, the character may use a free action to cast 'Death Ward' on the entire party within the grotto, without regard to range or spell slot availability. Death ward can only be granted to the party once in this manner (so a second player receiving this blessing cannot cast it again).
3. Blessing of the Seeker.

    > The character is imbued with slight premonition. They gain advantage on any dex/str saving throws, and gain +5AC.

These buffs cannot be stacked, and once granted cannot be replaced with a new one unless removed by dispel magic or a similar effect.

**Without the DC20/15 arcane check:**

-  The columns can be touched, but the blessing given is random. The details of each blessing is revealed at the time they are gained, rather than all three blessings being revealed upon successfull arcane check.
## Mobs

In addition to the Aboleth, the grotto can potentially be inhabited with:

- 1d4 Crocodiles (CR1)
- 1d4 Poisonous Snakes (CR1)
- 1 Giant Snapping Turtle (CR3)
- 1 Cave Fisher (CR3)

While the crocodiles or poisonous snakes will not actively engage the party, the giant snapping turtle/cave fisher will.
Any creatures in combat with the party will attempt to disengage and flee the grotto if the Aboleth enters the entrance passage.

## Loot

Littered around the grotto there are skelletons of past victums in various stages of decay. Their armor and weapory is generally intact, but of generally low quality. Suggestions:

- Up to 3d8 simple weapons.
- Up to 2d6 martial melee weapons.
- 1d4 sets of armor.
- A satchel containing 1d4 potions of healing, a healer's kit, and some incense.

At the deepest part of the pool is a small door made of lead that can be seen with a DC25 perception check if the person is searching in the pool while the aboleth is alive. This is reduced to DC15 if the aboleth is dead, and is DC1 for any character afflicted with the aboleth's mucus cloud disease. The character must attempt the search while in the water to be able to notice the door.

The door appears very old, but sturdy. It can be opened with a DC10 strength check. Upon opening, there appears to be a magical barrier preventing water from entering the space under the grotto. A character is able to pass through this barrier without issue. A DC5 perception check reveals a wooden 10ft ladder extending down from the barrier. Rushing in without the check will cause the character to fall 10ft to the ground inside the barrier. This space is the vault.

## The Vault

This secret area under the grotto's main pool is surprisingly dry. It contains a rather sizable collection of scrolls and parchement. The entire area glows with the same arcane energy that lit the ceiling of the grotto. 

Potentially:

- The diary and construction notes for the tower at Lake Barotok.
    > Requires 10hrs of study to read and understand, after which any character who studied it will know the physical layout of the tower. DC15 arcane check to be able to pinpoint the location of all rooms with magical traps/puzzles. DC25 arcane check to have complete understanding, including knowledge of how to disarm each trapped room, giving the character advantage to disarm any trap in the tower if the trap can be disarmed, and advantage on any puzzle-solving related skill checks. An action can be used to consult the book for guidance while exploring the tower.
- Some amount of scrolls.
- Other magic treasure.
- Wisdom/arcane boosting potions.
- A very rusty-looking steel key on a heavily tarnished silver chain.
    > This key requires 1hr attunement. Once attuned, the key allows the holder to teleport itself and up to 10 other creatures within 15ft to the top of the tower from anywhere in Barovia.
