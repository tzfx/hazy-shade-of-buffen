# A Hazy Shade of Buffen

The intention of this repository is to track a neat homebrew DnD 5e module!

## About

This module's creation happened due to our Druid (Buffen) diving headlong into a deep lake, right into an aboleth.  
Within 15 seconds, he was mind-controlled, with no realistic way of us retreiveing him or fighting the aboleth underwater.  
So, we left him to rot. RIP.  

This module centers around Buffen's memories, exploring his backstory as the Aboleth pries its way deeper and deeper into Buffen's psyche.  
Each memory is set up to be run as a one-shot, with little real connection between each other. If everything goes according to plan, the module should culminate in a final battle against the aboleth.

Character sheet data should be provided for each of the NPCs, allowing party members to portray them directly.  
Alternatively, player characters can be their own PCs, with the understanding that, to Buffen they will look and speak like the NPCs of his memories.  

Or whatever!

## Directories

From this README, there are a few directories that will have module information.

1. Locations - In this directory should be files for each specific location.
2. Memories - In this directory should be files for each memory/scenario/one-shot.
3. NPC - In this directory should be files for each important NPC.
